          <figure class = " test shadows"> <figure>Throughout my high school experience I have had the opportunity to experience many different career paths and see what I want to do in the future. <br><br> I have done some research into different careers, for example by taking Foothill classes on programming. This allowed me to truely see if I enjoyed computer science and the development process that came with it. Through these classes, I realized that I loved solving problems and putting these solutions down in code. This has encouraged me to pursue computer science in college and as a career in the future. <br><br> Some experiences I have had in computer science include tutoring in competitive programming. Competitive programming demands both problem-solving and implementation skills. As a teacher, I taught students about problem solving methods and tips on implementation. I worked on my delivery and teaching skills, as well as my own programming skills. This has only made me more excited for a career in computer science in the future. </figure> </figure>
