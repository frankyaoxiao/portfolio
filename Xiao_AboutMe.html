          <figure class = "col-sm-8 pclass test shadows">Hello, my name is Frank Xiao and I am currently at 9th grader at Dublin High School. My interests include computer science and mathematics. Right now, I hope get into the engineering academy, so I can pursue computer science down the road. I am also preparing for the AMC 10, which is the biggest math competition in the United States. In my free time, I like to play video games and read. This year, I am taking many interesting and fun classes, like Computer Science Principles, Orchestra, and Honors Chemistry. I am also learning new things outside of school, such as Mandarin and Economics. All of this provides a good challenge to me, helping me further myself in my academic career.  <br><br> My abilities include the ability to challenge myself with new things, such as hard classes or a new coding language, and the ability to absorb information quickly once I am taught it. This allows for me to learn quickly and accurately. <br><br> My personality is one of an analytical nature. Whenever there is a problem, I tend to analyze the problem first, to see how it can be solved, and which way would be the easiest. I think this suits me because I like math and computer science, and to solve problems in these subjects you have to carefully analyze the issues first. <br><br>These are a few of the experiences that I have had so far in my academic journey. All in all, I hope that you will look throught this website to learn about me and my work. </figure>
