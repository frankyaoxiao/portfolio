      <h2>Scratch Project</h2>
      <h3>CSP</h3>
      <h5> September 3-11, 2019</h5>
      
      
      <figure> This was a project that I worked on in Computer Science Principles with my partner. This project was a great introductory project to the world of coding. Utilizing Scratch's drag and drop style of coding, my partner and I created this game. This game is a simple platformer that uses the four arrows to move. I was aiming to create a platformer that would be easy to figure out but hard to master. The most challenging part of this project was the physics of the block, which required some creative thinking to create. Overall, I think this project was a success, and that it helped me learn more about coding.   </figure>

      <h2>MIT AppInventor Project</h2>
      <h3>CSP</h3>
      <h5> September 3-11, 2019</h5>
      
      
      <figure> In this project, my partner and I created an app using MIT AppInventor. In this project, I learned about app development, and the challenges that come with it. In the this project specifically, one challenge that we faced is that in our app("Oh My Spikes"), the spikes on the sides of the screen were not sizing correctly, so we had to fix the spike sizing. Another challenge was that the bird's "flapping" was very blocky, so we had to use some creative physics to make it look better. In the end, after lots of hard work, I think the app turned out to be decent.   </figure>

                                          <figure> In this project, we used Java to modify a game using Greenfoot. In this project, we learned about data structures and algorithms.</figure>

      <h2>Image Manipulation Project</h2>
      <h3>CSP</h3>
      <h5> March 16 - April 4,2020</h5>
      
      
      <figure> In this project, my partner and I created a program with a host of image manipulation functions. In this project, we were exposed to the numpy, PILLOW, and OpenCV libraries. One challenging part of this project was when we were trying to remove the background of images. This was challenging because we had to have a computer figure out by itself where the foreground and the background is. We ended up using the OpenCV grabcut method to solve this problem. Overall, this project was a good intro to python project.   </figure>
